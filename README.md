Read Until
==========

If you are anything like us, reading a README is the last thing you do when running code. 
PLEASE DON'T DO THAT FOR READ UNTIL. This will effect changes to your sequencing and - 
if you use it incorrectly - cost you money. We have added a [list of GOTCHAs](#common-gotchas) 
at the end of this README. We have almost certainly missed some... so - if something goes 
wrong, let us know so we can add you to the GOTCHA hall of fame!

This is a Python3 package that integrates with the 
[Read Until API](https://github.com/nanoporetech/read_until_api). However, we use 
a slightly modified version - [Read Until API V2](https://github.com/looselab/read_until_api_v2).  

The Read Until API provides a mechanism for an application to connect to a
MinKNOW server to obtain read data in real-time. The data can be analysed in the
way most fit for purpose, and a return call can be made to the server to unblock
the read in progress and so direct sequencing capacity towards reads of interest.

**This implementation of Read Until requires Guppy version 3.4 or newer. It will 
not work on earlier versions.**

**Currently we only recommend LINUX for running Read Until. We have not had 
effective performance on other platforms to date.**

The code here has been tested with Guppy in GPU mode using GridION Mk1 and 
NVIDIA RTX2080 on live sequencing runs and an NIVIDA GTX1080 using playback 
on a simulated run (see below for how to test this).  
This code is run at your own risk as it DOES affect sequencing output. You 
are **strongly** advised to test your setup prior to running (see below for 
example tests).

TOML File

Testing
-------
To test Read Until on your configuration we recommend first running a playback 
experiment to test unblock speed and then selection.

#### Configuring bulk FAST5 file Playback
1. Download an open access bulk FAST5 file from 
[here](http://s3.amazonaws.com/nanopore-human-wgs/bulkfile/PLSP57501_20170308_FNFAF14035_MN16458_sequencing_run_NOTT_Hum_wh1rs2_60428.fast5). 
This file is 21Gb so make sure you have plenty of space.
1. To configure a run for playback, you need to find and edit a sequencing TOML 
file. These are typically located in `/opt/ont/minknow/conf/package/sequencing`. 
Edit a file such as sequencing_MIN106_DNA.toml and under the entry `[custom_settings]` 
add a field: 
    ```text
    simulation = "/full/path/to/your_bulk.FAST5"
    ```
3. If running GUPPY in GPU mode, set the parameter `break_reads_after_seconds = 1.0` 
to `break_reads_after_seconds = 0.4`.
4. In the MinKNOW GUI, right click on a sequencing position and select `Reload Scripts`. 
Your version of MinKNOW will now playback the bulkfile rather than live sequencing.
5. Insert a configuration test flowcell into the sequencing device.
6. Start a sequencing run as you would normally, selecting the corresponding flow 
cell type to the edited script (here FLO-MIN106) as the flowcell type.
7. The run should start and immediately begin a mux scan. Let it run for around 
five minutes after which your read length histogram should look as below:
    ![alt text](examples/images/control.png "Control Image")

#### Testing unblock response
Now we shall test unblocking by running `ru_unblock_all` which will simply eject 
every single read on the flow cell. 
1. To do this run:
    ```bash
    ru_unblock_all --device <YOUR_DEVICE_ID> --experiment-name "Testing Read Until Unblock All"
    ```   
1. Leave the run for a further 5 minutes and observe the read length histogram. 
If unblocks are happening correctly you will see something like the below:
    ![alt text](examples/images/Unblock.png "Unblock Image")
A closeup of the unblock peak shows reads being unblocked quickly:
    ![alt text](examples/images/Unblock_closeup.png "Closeup Unblock Image")    

If you are happy with the unblock response, move onto testing basecalling.

#### Testing basecalling and mapping.
To test selective sequencing you must have access to a 
[guppy basecall server](https://community.nanoporetech.com/downloads/guppy/release_notes) (>=3.4.0) 
and configure a [TOML](TOML.md) file. Here we provide an [example TOML file](examples/human_chr_selection.toml).
1. First make a local copy of the example TOML file:
    ```bash
    curl -O https://github.com/LooseLab/ru/blob/master/examples/human_chr_selection.toml
    ```
1. Modify the `reference` field in the file to be the full path to a [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) index of the human genome.
1. Modify the `targets` fields for each condition to reflect the naming convention used in your index. This is the sequence name only, up to but not including any whitespace.
e.g. `>chr1 human chromosome 1` would become `chr1`. If these names do not match, then target matching will fail.
1. We provide a [JSON schema](ru/static/ru_toml.schema.json) and a script for validating 
configuration files which will let you check if the toml will drive an experiment as you expect:
    
    ```bash
    ru_validate human_chr_selection.toml
    ```

    Errors with the configuration will be written to the terminal along with a text description of the conditions for the experiment as below.
    
    ```text
    ru_validate examples/human_chr_selection.toml
    ðŸ˜» Looking good!
    Generating experiment description - please be patient!
    This experiment has 1 region on the flowcell

    Using reference: /path/to/reference.mmi

    Region 'select_chr_21_22' (control=False) has 2 targets of which 2 are
    in the reference. Reads will be unblocked when classed as single_off
    or multi_off; sequenced when classed as single_on or multi_on; and
    polled for more data when classed as no_map or no_seq.
    ```         
1. If your toml file validates then run the following command:
    ```bash
    ru_generators --device <YOUR_DEVICE_ID> \
                  --experiment-name "RU Test basecall and map" \
                  --toml <PATH_TO_TOML> \
                  --log-file ru_test.log
    ```
1. In the terminal window you should see messages reporting the speed of mapping of the form:
    ```text
    2020-02-24 16:45:35,677 ru.ru_gen 7R/0.03526s
    2020-02-24 16:45:35,865 ru.ru_gen 3R/0.02302s
    2020-02-24 16:45:35,965 ru.ru_gen 4R/0.02249s
    ```
   **Note: if these times are longer than 0.4 seconds you will have performance issues. Contact us via github issues for support.**

1. In the MinKNOW messages interface you should see the experiment description as generated by the ru_validate command above.   
        ![alt text](examples/images/minknow_messages.png "MinKNOW Messages") 

 #### Testing expected results from a selection experiment.
 
 The only way to test read until on a playback run is to look at changes in read length for rejected vs accepted reads. To do this:
 
 1. Start a fresh simulation run using the bulkfile provided above.
 2. Restart the read until command (as above):
    ```bash
    ru_generators --device <YOUR_DEVICE_ID> \
                  --experiment-name "RU Test basecall and map" \
                  --toml <PATH_TO_TOML> \
                  --log-file ru_test.log
    ```
 3. Allow the run to proceed for at least 15 minutes (making sure you are writing out read data!).
 4. After 15 minutes it should look something like this:
        ![alt text](examples/images/PlaybackRunUnblock.png "Playback Unblock Image")
Zoomed in on the unblocks: 
        ![alt text](examples/images/PlaybackRunUnblockCloseUp.png "Closeup Playback Unblock Image")
 4. Run `ru_summarise_fq` to check if your run has performed as expected. This file requires the path to your toml file followed by the path to your fastq reads. Typical results are provided below and show longer mean read lengths for the two selected chromosomes (here chr21 and chr22). Note the mean read lengths observed will be dependent on system performance. Optimal guppy configuration for your system is left to the user.

 **After completing your tests you should remove the simulation line from the sequencing_MIN106_DNA.toml file. You MUST then reload the scripts. If using Guppy GPU basecalling leave the break_reads_after_seconds parameter as 0.4.** 
 
 Common Gotcha's
 ----
 These may or may not (!) be mistakes we have made already...
 1. If the previous run has not fully completed - i.e is still basecalling or processing raw data,you may connect to the wrong instance and see nothing happening. Always check the previous run has finished completely.
 2. If you have forgotten to remove your simultation line from your sequencing toml you will forever be trapped in an inception like resequencing of old data... Don't do this!
 3. If basecalling doesn't seem to be working check:
    - Check your basecalling server is running.
    - Check the ip of your server is correct.
    - Check the port of your server is correct.
 4. If you are expecting reads to unblock but they do not - check that you have set `control=false` in your ru_generators toml file.  `control=true` will prevent any unblocks but does otherwise run the full analysis pipeline.
 5. Oh no - every single read is being unblocked - I have nothing on target! 
    - Double check your reference file is in the correct location.
    - Double check your targets exist in that reference file.
    - Double check your targets are correctly formatted with contig name matching the record names in your reference (Exclude description - i.e the contig name up to the first whitespace). 
 6. **Where has my reference gone?** If you are using a _live TOML file - e.g running iter_align or iter_cent, the previous reference MMI file is deleted when a new one is added. This obviosuly saves on disk space use(!) but can lead to unfortunate side effects - i.e you delete yoru MMI file. These can of course be recreated but user **beware**.
 
 Happy Read Untilling!
