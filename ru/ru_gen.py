"""unblock_all.py

ReadUntil implementation that will only unblock reads. This should result in
a read length histogram that has very short peaks (~280-580bp) as these are the
smallest chunks that we can acquire. If you are not seeing these peaks, the
`split_reads_after_seconds` parameter in the configuration file may need to be
edited to 0.2-0.4:

    This experiment has N regions on the flowcell.

    using reference: /path/to/ref.mmi

    Region i:NAME (control=bool) has X targets of which Y are found in the reference.
    reads will be unblocked when [u,v], sequenced when [w,x] and polled for more data when [y,z].
